# Data Transformation Case Study

## Background  
As part of the data team at NTX Solution, we handle diverse datasets daily. Our primary responsibility is to acquire, process, and analyze data to provide valuable insights and solutions for our clients.

## Case Study  
Our client, an e-commerce platform, wants to gain a deeper understanding of user behavior to improve their platform. The management has identified key analytical needs, including:

1. **Identifying Top Products:** Determine the top-selling products based on total transaction revenue per day.  
2. **Detecting Anomalies:** Identify unusual transaction patterns, such as a sharp increase or decrease in sales for a specific product.  
3. **Finding Most Profitable Locations:** Determine which city or province generates the highest total transaction revenue.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this analysis is a subset of the **'data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions'** dataset from Google BigQuery. It includes information such as:  

- **Visitor ID** (Unique identifier for visitors)  
- **Visit Time** (Timestamp of the visit)  
- **Product SKU & Product Name** (Product identifiers and descriptions)  
- **Transaction Count** (Number of transactions for each product)  
- **City & Province** (Geographical data related to transactions)  

## Tasks  
You will complete the following tasks in two main phases:

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis Using ChatGPT  
1. **Generate Insights with ChatGPT**  
   - Use ChatGPT as an assistant to help solve the case study.  
   - Ask relevant questions to ChatGPT, such as how to structure the analysis, preprocess the data, or detect anomalies.  
   - Document each prompt given to ChatGPT and its corresponding response.  

2. **Evaluate ChatGPT’s Responses**  
   - Analyze the results generated by ChatGPT.  
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses in its approach.  
   - Note any limitations or inaccuracies in the suggested methodology.  

### Phase 2: Improving the Solution  
1. **Refine the Analysis**  
   - Improve upon ChatGPT’s solution by addressing gaps in its methodology.  
   - Enhance data processing, statistical accuracy, anomaly detection, and visualization.  
   - Implement better handling of edge cases or missing data.  

2. **Provide Justifications for Improvements**  
   - Clearly explain why each modification is necessary.  
   - Demonstrate how the improvements lead to a more reliable and actionable analysis.  

## Deliverables  
You will present your work in a **Jupyter Notebook** (or an equivalent environment). Ensure your submission includes the following:

- **Detailed Documentation**  
  - Include all ChatGPT prompts and responses.  
  - Explain your thought process at each stage.  
  - Justify all improvements made to ChatGPT’s solution.  

- **Data Processing & Analysis**  
  - Show data preprocessing steps (cleaning, transformation, aggregation).  
  - Present clear insights using descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
  - Implement anomaly detection and discuss findings.  

- **Final Insights & Recommendations**  
  - Summarize key findings on top products, anomalies, and profitable locations.  
  - Provide recommendations for the client based on the analysis.  

## Evaluation Criteria  
Your work will be assessed based on:  
✔ **Clarity & Documentation** – Well-structured explanations and code comments.  
✔ **Analytical Depth** – Effective data processing and insightful analysis.  
✔ **Innovative Improvements** – Enhancements beyond ChatGPT’s initial suggestions.  
✔ **Actionable Insights** – Meaningful recommendations for the client.
