## Context
For this challenge, you're provided with a CSV dataset sourced from `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions` in "Soal 1 - Data Transformation and Analysis Case". Your task is to import this dataset into your preferred SQL environment and perform a series of analyses. This challenge aims to assess your capabilities in data ingestion, transformation, and SQL-based analysis.

## Instructions

1. **Set Up**:
    - Use the CSV file "Soal 1 - Data Transformation and Analysis Case" containing the data from `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`.
    - Import the CSV into your SQL environment. You can choose any database system you're comfortable with (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).
    - Ensure that you familiarize yourself with the columns and data types in the dataset. Notable fields include `channelGrouping`, `country`, `fullVisitorId`, `timeOnSite`, `pageviews`, `sessionQualityDim`, `v2ProductName`, `productRevenue`, `productQuantity`, and `productRefundAmount`.

2. **Test Case 1: Channel Analysis**
    - Craft an SQL query to ascertain the total revenue generated from each channel grouping for the top 5 countries producing the highest revenue.

3. **Test Case 2: User Behavior Analysis**
    - Derive insights into user behavior. Calculate metrics like average `timeOnSite`, average `pageviews`, and average `sessionQualityDim` for each `fullVisitorId`. Identify users who spend above-average time on the site but view fewer pages than the average user.

4. **Test Case 3: Product Performance**
    - Understand the performance of each product. Design an SQL query that:
        1. Computes the total revenue generated by each product (`v2ProductName`).
        2. Determines the total quantity sold for each product.
        3. Calculates the total refund amount for each product.
    - Rank products based on their net revenue (total revenue minus refunds) in a descending order. Flag any product with a refund amount surpassing 10% of its total revenue.

5. **Evaluation**:
    - Your SQL scripts will be evaluated for correctness, efficiency, and clarity.
    - Please provide explanations or comments for each of your scripts, describing your approach and any assumptions you made.

6. **Submission**:
    - Ensure to submit your SQL scripts clearly labeled for each test case.
    - Attach a brief report or set of comments outlining your understanding of the data, any data quality issues you noticed, and the insights you derived from each analysis.

Ensure you structure your queries in a clear manner, and validate your results to ensure accuracy. Remember, this challenge is not only about getting the right results but also about demonstrating your analytical thought process and SQL proficiency.

Good Luck!
